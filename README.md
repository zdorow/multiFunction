# multiFunction
Create a function named multiFunction.  Pass two integer variables and one character variable to this function.  The character variable will hold + (add), - (subtract), * (multiply), and / (divide).  The function will determine which operation to perform based on the character variable.  Within the function, use your choice of decision statements (e.g., if or switch) to determine which arithmetic operation to perform.  The add operation will add the two integer variables, the subtract operation will subtract one integer variable from the other and so on.  The function will return the result of the operation performed.
